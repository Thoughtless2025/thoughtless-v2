# Thoughtless App: Frontend Design

This document outlines the key design principles, components, and user flow considerations for the frontend of the Thoughtless App, covering both the web and mobile applications.

## Universal Design Principles:

*   **User-Centric:** Prioritize ease of use, intuitive navigation, and a visually appealing interface.
*   **Performance:** Optimize for smooth scrolling, fast loading times, and efficient resource usage.
*   **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent look and feel across platforms where appropriate, while also adhering to platform-specific design guidelines (e.g., Material Design for Android).
*   **Accessibility:** Design with accessibility in mind, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and other assistive technologies.
*   **Modularity:** Structure the code in a modular way to facilitate maintenance, testing, and future feature additions.

## Core Components & User Flow:

This section describes the core functionality of the app, applicable to both web and mobile platforms.

### Key Components:

*   **Chat List View:** Displays a list of available chat sessions, likely with titles and potentially a brief summary or last message preview.
*   **Chat Detail View:** Shows the full conversation of a selected chat session, including messages from both the AI and the user.
*   **Message Input Area:** A text input field and send button for users to compose and send messages.
*   **User Authentication Flow:** Screens and logic for user sign-up, login, and potentially password reset.
*   **Settings/Profile Screen:** Allows users to manage their profile and app settings.
*   **Contributor Features Interface:** Dedicated screens or sections for users with contributor status to create new chats, manage their content, etc.
*   **Admin Interface (Web-Only):** The admin interface will only be available on the web application.

### User Flow Considerations:

*   **App Launch:** What the user sees when they open the app (e.g., a loading screen, the chat list).
*   **Viewing Chats:** How users browse and select chat sessions to view.
*   **Participating in Chats:** The process of reading messages and sending replies.
*   **Creating New Chats (Contributors Only):** The workflow for contributors to initiate a new chat session.
*   **User Authentication:** The steps involved in signing up, logging in, and managing user sessions.
*   **App Navigation:** How users move between different sections of the app.

## Backend Integration:

The frontend will interact with the Firebase backend services (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions) to manage user accounts, store and retrieve chat data, and execute backend logic.

*   Firestore will be used as the primary database for storing chat messages and session metadata.
*   Firebase Authentication will handle user registration and login.
*   Cloud Functions may be used for backend logic triggered by frontend actions or database changes.

## Future Considerations:

*   Offline support for viewing cached chat data.
*   Push notifications for new messages or chat updates.
*   Search functionality for finding specific chats or messages.
*   Integration with AI models for potential on-device features (if applicable and feasible).

## Platform-Specific Implementations:

### Web App

*   **Technology Stack:** React, Vite, Tailwind CSS.
*   **UI/UX Notes:** The web app will be the primary interface for admin users.

### Mobile App (Android)

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Language:** Kotlin (preferred) or Java.
    *   **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose (preferred for modern Android development) or XML Layouts.
    *   **Architecture:** Recommended to follow a modern Android architecture pattern like MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).
    *   **Networking:** Libraries like Retrofit or Ktor for interacting with the backend API.
    *   **Local Data Storage:** If necessary, Room Database for structured local data or SharedPreferences for simple key-value storage.
    *   **Firebase SDKs:** Integration with Firebase Authentication, Firestore, and potentially other relevant Firebase services.
