# Debugging Summary: Gemini Adapter

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create a Gemini adapter that can be used in a larger application. The application allows users to interact with various chatbots (Gemini, Claude, etc.) through a common frontend.

## Architecture

-   **Frontend:** A common UI for all chatbots.
-   **Backend (Middleware):**
    -   Determines which chatbot adapter to use.
    -   Connects to the chatbot.
    -   Sends the prompt and receives the response.
    -   Writes the conversation to Firestore.
    -   Notifies the frontend to refresh.
-   **Adapters:** Separate modules for each chatbot.

## Gemini Adapter Requirements

-   The Gemini adapter must handle user authentication with Google.
-   The user does not have to be signed in to the main application with a Google account. They can be logged in with any method (email/password, Apple ID, etc.).
-   When the user chooses to use the Gemini chatbot, the adapter must trigger a separate Google OAuth flow to authenticate the user with Google for Gemini usage.
-   The resulting tokens must be securely stored for that user.

## The Problem

The backend function (`api`) is not working as expected. We have been trying to debug a simple `/hello` endpoint, but it consistently returns a "Cannot GET /hello" error, even with the simplest possible "Hello World" code.

## Debugging Steps

1.  **Initial Setup:** We started with a backend function that had several endpoints for the OAuth flow and for sending messages to the chatbot.
2.  **Frontend-Backend Communication:** We initially suspected that the problem was with the Firebase Hosting rewrite rules, which were supposed to forward requests from the frontend to the backend. We tried various configurations of the rewrite rules, but nothing worked.
3.  **Direct URL:** We then tried to bypass the rewrite rules by using the direct URL of the cloud function in the frontend. This also failed, but with a different error ("Cannot GET /hello"), which indicated that the request was reaching the backend, but the route was not being found.
4.  **Backend Isolation:** We then decided to test the backend in isolation, without the frontend. We used `curl` to send requests directly to the backend.
5.  **Logging:** We added logging to the backend to see the registered routes and to trace the execution flow. However, the logs did not show our `console.log` statements, which indicated that the function was not executing our code at all.
6.  **Build Step:** We discovered that we were not running the `npm run build` command for the backend, which is necessary to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript. We fixed this and redeployed the function.
7.  **"Hello World" Test:** Even after fixing the build process, the `/hello` endpoint still failed with "Cannot GET /hello". We then simplified the backend to a minimal "Hello World" example, but the error persisted.

## Current Status

-   We have a minimal "Hello World" backend function that is deployed to Firebase Functions.
-   When we call the function's URL with `curl`, we get a "Cannot GET /hello" error.
-   The logs show that the function is being executed, but it is finishing with a 404 status code, and our `console.log` statements are not appearing.
-   We have concluded that the problem is likely with the Firebase project configuration or the environment itself, and not with the code.

## Next Steps

The user has decided to create a new, clean Firebase project to rule out any issues with the current project's configuration. This summary will be used to transfer the context of our conversation to a new Gemini CLI instance in the new project.
